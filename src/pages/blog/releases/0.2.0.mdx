# Release v0.2.0

Welcome to NumCross! Our _super_ private pre-pre-pre-alpha has wrapped up,
so we thought it was time to share our progress with the world. We've cleaned
up a bunch of internal tools and fixed crucial bugs to bring you a **perfect** 0.2.0.
Well, probably not, but that's what 1.0.0 is for anyway.

## New Features

- Enhanced user stats after a successful solve.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with the global leaderboard.
- Optimized workflows to improve page load time.
